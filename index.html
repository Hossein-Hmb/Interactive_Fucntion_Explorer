            <h1>Uncertainty Principle</h1>
            <p>
              All functions that are plotted must represent physical states. As
              such, they have to obey the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty
              principle is an important concept in quantum mechanics. This
              principle, originally formulated by Heisenberg, states that one
              cannot know the exact measurement of the position $x$ and momentum
              $p$ of a particle. There is a limit to the precision expressed
              through the inequality
            </p>
            <p>\[ \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \]</p>
            <p>
              If for example you know the momentum and you try to find the
              position you do not get the exact value, but only a probability of
              where that particle might have been at time $t$.

            <p>
              The Wigner function is a quasi-probability distribution function
              used in quantum mechanics to represent a quantum state of a system
              in the phase space. It provides a way to visualize the probability
              of measuring the position or the momentum of a quantum system,
              allowing for the analysis of its properties and dynamics. This
              distribution is not a true distribution as it can become negative,
              showcasing here a quantum feature of some states. A Fock state is
              a quantum state which has exactly $n$ photons (or quanta of
              light). They are represented by the following Wigner function
              where $L_n(x)$ are the Laguerre polynomials.

            <h1>Gaussian Wigner Function 2D</h1>
            <p>
              The Gaussian Wigner function is a specific form of the Wigner
              function that describes a Gaussian state in phase space. It is
              completely characterized by the first moments (average value of
              position $\langle x \rangle$ and momentum $\langle p \rangle$) and
              covariance matrix $\gamma$ whose elements are given by:
            </p>
            <p>
              \[ \gamma _{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\langle\{\hat{r}_i,\hat{r}_j\}\rangle
              - \langle{\hat{r}_i}\rangle\langle{\hat{r}_j}\rangle.\]
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, {.} stand for the anti-commutator and $r$ is a column vector
              of the position and momentum variables of a particle, that is $r =
              (x, p)^T$. On this platform, we will only consider states that are
              centered at the origin such that $\langle{x}\rangle =
              \langle{p}\rangle = 0$. Therefore, the Gaussian Wigner function is
              defined as
            </p>
            <p>
              \[ W(r) =
              \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\det(\gamma)}}\,e^{-\tfrac12\,r^T\gamma^{-1}r}
              \]
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that $\gamma$ must satisfy the uncertainty principle of
              Heisenberg, but also its improved version from
              Robertson-Schr√∂dinger, which states that the determinant of the
              covariance matrix must be greater than or equal to
              $\frac{\hbar^2}{4}$. This uncertainty principle can also be
              written as
            </p>
            <p>
              \[ \gamma \pm \frac{i\hbar\Omega}{2} \geq 0 \quad \text{where}
              \quad \Omega = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\-1 & 0\end{bmatrix} \]
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that on this platform, we chose to put $\hbar = 1$ and the
              commutator of $x$ and $p$ is given by $[x, p] = i.$

            <p>
              The Gaussian Wigner function in four dimensions extends the
              concept of the 2D Gaussian Wigner function from 1 particle to 2
              particles. It is used to represent more complex quantum states and
              their interactions. The 4D Gaussian Wigner function is defined
              similarly to the 2D case, but it describes a two states-system $A$
              and $B$, each represented by a $2\times2$ covariance matrix. As
              such, the global covariance matrix $\gamma$, describing the
              Gaussian function, is now a $4\times4$ matrix and the vector $r =
              (x_A, p_A, x_B, p_B)^T$ is 4 dimensional. Still considering states
              centered at the origin, the Wigner function is given by:
            </p>
            <p>
              \[ W(r) =
              \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{2}\sqrt{\det(\gamma)}}\,e^{-\tfrac12\,r^T\gamma^{-1}r}
              \]

          <section id="coupling">
            <h1>Coupling Matrix</h1>
            <p>
              A coupling between two states is a higher dimension system that
              reduces to the original states when one look at the marginal, but
              contains some more information in the correlations. When both
              states are Gaussian, the coupling is Gaussian too and as such, is
              described by a covariance matrix. The coupling matrix is essential
              in the calculation of some quantities such as the Wasserstein
              distance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let us assume we have two states represented by covariances
              matrices $A$ and $B$, each satisfying the uncertainty principle
              and let us define
            </p>
            <p>\[A^\pm = A \pm \frac{i\Omega}{2}\]</p>
            <p>
              and similarly for $B^\pm$. The coupling matrix is a $4\times4$
              matrix that describes the interaction between the two states. It
              is defined as:
            </p>
            <p>
              \[ \gamma\Pi = \begin{bmatrix} A & X^T\\ X & B \end{bmatrix} \]
            </p>
            <p>where $X$ can be anything as long as it verifies:</p>
            <p>\[X^T A^{-1} X \le B\]</p>
            <p>
              (which is just an expression of the uncertainty principle). With
              the coupling matrix, we can analyse the possible interactions
              between the two states and how they influence each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              The image below shows a 3D plot of a coupling matrix. The $X$ and
              $Y$ axes represent the basis states, and the $Z$ axis represents
              the coupling strength between the two states. The color gradient
              indicates the degree of coupling, with darker colors representing
              stronger interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, the position variable is represented by the letter $Q$ and
              the momentum by the letter $P$. The first system is described by
              the covariance matrix $A$ and the second by the covariance matrix
              $B$.

          <section id="wasserstein">
            <h1>Wasserstein Distance</h1>
            <p>
              The Wasserstein distance is a metric used to measure the distance
              between two probability distributions. In the context of quantum
              mechanics, it can be used to quantify the differences between
              quantum states represented by their Wigner functions. The
              Wasserstein distance is the result of an optimization over all
              possible couplings between the two states. When both states are
              Gaussian, the Wasserstein distance is defined as
            </p>
            <p>
              \[ W(\rho_A, \rho_B)^2 =
              \frac{1}{2}TrA+\frac{1}{2}TrB-Tr[X_\text{optimal}] \]
            </p>
            <p>
              where $A$ and $B$ are the covariance matrices of the two states,
              and $X_\text{optimal}$ is given by:
            </p>
            <p>\[|X| = \sqrt{\sqrt{A^\pm}B^{\mp}\sqrt{A^\pm}}\]</p>
            <p>
              The Wasserstein distance is a powerful tool for comparing quantum
              states and analyzing their properties. It is particularly useful
              in quantum information theory and quantum optics. For example, the
              Wasserstein distance can demonstrate the optimal path between two
              states $A$ and $B$ where the value of the cost function is at a
              minimum.
